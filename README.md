## (Optional) My typical VM prereqs

If running Hyper-V in a Virtual Machine with Nested Virtualization

- From the hyper-v host enable nested virtualization for the virtual machine

```powershell
Set-VMProcessor -VMName <VMName> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
```

- If running VMware:

```powershell
$VM = Get-VM -Name <VMName>
$Spec = New-Object VMware.Vim.VirtualMachineConfigSpec
$Spec.nestedHVEnabled = $true
$VM.ExtensionData.ReconfigVM($Spec)
```

## Install chocolatey

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

## Install Git

```powershell
choco install git -y
```

## Running wsl-config.sh in wsl

After cloning the repo and you exectute the script in wsl using bash i.e.

```bash
# reference Example
sudo ./mnt/c/temp/my-wsl-setup/wsl-config.sh
```

You can remove trailing \r characters if you dont want to install dos2unix if your creating a shell script on windows when doing a binary copy to liux

```shell
sed -i 's/\r$//' .\wsl-config.sh
```

## WSL-Setup

List distros to install

```powershell
wsl --list --online
```

to list currently installed distros

```powershell
wsl -l -v
```

Install by name if you don't want the default

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
```

From an elevated Powershell. Or, use the windows store

```bash
wsl --install
```

To persist DNS resolv.conf after WSL reboot (may only be needed with wsl2 win11)

- Create wsl.conf file

```bash
sudo touch /etc/wsl.conf
```

- Edit wsl.conf file:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf
```

```yaml
#config
[network]
generateResolvConf = false
```

Configure resolve.conf for dns lookup

- Edit resolv.conf

```bash
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
```

> **note**
> Replace IP Addresses with your preferred DNS provider

```yaml
#config
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

If needed, open powershell and restart wsl

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

### WSL-Setup-Troubleshooting

> **Warning**
> If resolv.conf settings get overwrittent after wsl restart, run the following to set the file(s) as immutable

```shell
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf'
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" >> /etc/resolv.conf'
sudo bash -c 'echo "[network]" > /etc/wsl.conf'
sudo bash -c 'echo "generateResolvConf = false" >> /etc/wsl.conf'
sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

#Makes file IMMUTABLE, nothing can change this file
#sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

#Makes file Changabley again, if you need to modify or delete it
#sudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
```

includedir /etc/krb5.conf.d/

[logging]
    default = FILE:/var/log/krb5libs.log
    kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log

[libdefaults]
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    renew_lifetime = 7d
    forwardable = true
    rdns = false
    pkinit_anchors = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    spake_preauth_groups = edwards25519
    default_realm = CONTOSO.COM
    default_ccache_name = KEYRING:persistent:%{uid}

[realms]
CONTOSO.COM = {

      kdc = ad01.contoso.com
      kdc = ad02.contoso.com

}

DMZ.CONTOSO.COM = {

      kdc = dmzad01.dmz.contoso.com
      kdc = dmzad02.dmz.contoso.com

}
```

## Setup-Git-in-WSL

- Install git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

To set up your Git config file, open a command line for the distribution you're working in and set your name with this command (replacing "Your Name" with your preferred username):

- Git config file setup:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

- Set your email with this command (replacing "youremail@domain.com" with the email you prefer):

```bash
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
```

- For AzureDevops Repos
  - To set up GCM for use with a WSL distribution, open your distribution and enter this command:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper "/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager-core.exe"
```

```bash
git config --global credential.https://dev.azure.com.useHttpPath true

### Ansible-Setup-Troubleshooting

> **Note**
> Remove ansible and re-install - need to investigate more, but
> when I blew my local wsl up this got me back to a working, and correct
> ansible version.
> <https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-and-configure-latest-version-of-ansible-on-ubuntu-linux/>

```bash
sudo apt -y remove ansible
sudo apt -y --purge autoremove
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt -y install ansible
```

> **Note**
> IF needed, to fix "kerberos: Bad HTTP response returned from server. Code 500"
> <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3486461>

```bash
pip install --upgrade {pywinrm,pykerberos,requests-kerberos,requests-ntlm}
```

> **Note**
> Optional - If needed, create krb5.conf.d directory with permissions DO NOT USE 777 unless trash lab and dont care

```bash
touch /etc/krb5.conf.d/
sudo mkdir /etc/krb5.conf.d/
sudo chmod 777 /etc/krb5.conf.d/
```

To remove a dir:

```bash
rm -d /etc/krb5.conf.d/
```

## Other-Notes
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git>
If you are seeking to access the Windows file directory from your WSL distribution command line, instead of C:\Users\username, the directory would be accessed using /mnt/c/Users/username, because the Linux distribution views your Windows file system as a mounted drive.

I was able to connect to my windows host after following those steps
However, I had to solve two more issues before I was able to run ansible playbooks against both, WSL and windows host:

1. Define connection for WSL
Windows host uses ```yaml ansible_connection=winrm```, but for WSL needs a different connection, I've set ```yaml ansible_connection=local```.

2. Avoid connection var being overriden
The ansible_connection var is overridden. This is because the var name and the host name is the same. This means that you can either run a playbook for WSL or for Windows host but not against both, as they need different connection.

To fix that you can either set hash-behaviour, or set two different host names for localhost under your WSL, /etc/hosts. I've done the second one:

```bash
127.0.0.1   wsl.local
127.0.0.1   windows.local
```

My /etc/ansible/hosts:

```bash
[wsl]
wsl.local 

[wsl:vars]
ansible_connection=local

[windows]
windows.local 
[windows:vars]
ansible_port=5985
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_transport=basic
ansible_user=<<ansible_user>>
ansible_password=<<ansible_password>>

```

For lab type environments, you may need to configure winrm for basic authentication.

```powershell
#Powershell
#Show winrm config
winrmwinrm get winrm/config
#Enable basic auth
Set-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\Service\Auth\Basic -Value $true
```

Now I can run an ansible_playbook with tasks running against both, my windows host and my WSL. Here for more details on configuration.
